  <p>
    I am currently a Master student at <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/">School of Computing</a>, 
    <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a>, working on <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI)</strong>.
    I am a part of <a href="https://www.ai4sg.org/"> AI4SG Lab </a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.yclee.net/"> Yi-Chieh (EJ) Lee </a>.
    My research focuses on HCI/HAI and is mainly divided into two parts. The first part involves understanding 
    human behavior when using AI/computer systems, such as understanding how LLMs' verbalized uncertainty affects 
    human users' behaviors in decision-making tasks. The second part involves building AI systems to help human 
    users better understand the world and bring them benefits, such as my current work on personalized learning 
    with LLMs.

  <p>
  I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from <a href="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/">Chu Kochen Honors College</a>, <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/">Zhejiang University</a>, 
  in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work on several research projects 
  in computer vision and computer graphics at the <a href="http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html">State Key Lab of CAD&CG</a>.

  If you share research interests or have topics to discuss, please feel free to contact me. 
  I'm always open to potential collaborations and insightful discussions.
