  <h3 class="mt-3">Open City: A First-person building/roaming game powered by OpenGL</h3>
  <p>
    This project involved developing a first-person building/roaming game using OpenGL. It included basic voxel-based modeling, supported importing OBJ format 3D meshes, and featured fundamental materials and textures. The game used depth-based fog effects and the Blinn-Phong lighting model for multi-light rendering with directional lights, point lights, and spotlights. Shadow mapping with Percentage-Closer Filtering (PCF) was used to render and soften shadows. Collision detection was implemented via the Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) algorithm. Additionally, it included a particle system and simulated water ripples through displacement mapping to enhance visual and interactive experiences.
